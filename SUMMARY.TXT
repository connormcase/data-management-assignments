I found it really interesting to learn more about Snowflake as a modern cloud based data warehouse. 
I had heard of it before but never really knew what it was, and I was surprised to see how it powers the entire data lifecycle while being easy to use, highly connected, and trusted by major corporations. 
What stood out most was the scale of adoption with more than 750 Forbes Global 2000 companies, including AT&T, DoorDash, Siemens, and Warner Music Group, relying on Snowflake to manage and innovate with their data.
